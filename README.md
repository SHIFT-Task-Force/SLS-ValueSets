# FHIR SLS and ValueSet Definitions

https://build.fhir.org/ig/SHIFT-Task-Force/slsValueSets/

The ValueSets and Profiles for classifying data into sensitive topics.

From the IG build all of the examples can be downloaded in json, xml, or ttl format. See the [About menu](https://build.fhir.org/ig/SHIFT-Task-Force/slsValueSets/download.html)

The IG can be built locally; if you have the [IG publisher environment](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/HAFWG/pages/204283403/Setup+FHIR+IG+Publisher+environment); by using the `_build` batch or script.

The json examples can be pulled from the CI build or a local build; and uploaded to a HAPI server using the `hapi-fhir-cli` `upload-dir` command.
